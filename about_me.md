## About Me
My name is Heng Li, I’m currently working for Unique Melody as a Marketing Specialist. In August 2020, I finished my master’s degree in Business Analytics at the University of Cincinnati. During this period, I have worked with the Great American Insurance Group on a Sentiment Analysis project using natural language processing and machine learning methods. I eventually applied the latest model to their business as a product evaluator in the summer 2020. I also did research on a supply chain/inventory management problem in January 2020. The paper “Research on a Dual Problem Solution Strategy under Supply Hub Mode” is currently reviewing and planning to resubmit to the Journal of Supply Chain Management. Before I came to the US, I started my own music studio in China since 2015. I did a one-year survey-based marketing research before I initiate the business. I constructed my own business model and my store became one of few profitable music studios in the industry in the city.

I’m currently looking for research opportunities in Marketing or Finance fields. My research interests lean more towards quantitative marketing, consumer behavior for marketing. Risk management and asset pricing for finance.
