# Business Experience

## ShengShi TaiZi Media Co.–Founder
>In 2014, I started the ShenShi TaiZi Media Company. The initial goal of my company was to provide music education to people from the age of 5 and above. Prior to that, I did a one-year excessive market research of the music industry. I found the traditional business operation model was simply providing overpriced music instruments to students and hire less experienced instructors. In this way, these companies can limit the total cost and charge less from their customers while still being profitable. However, the consequence is that students cannot use suitable quality instruments and they will not receive a high standard of education. The students end up spending more time, paying more money than they expected, and have fewer improvements. In the long run, this business model will hurt the company’s reputation dramatically.

>Therefore, I started my business with an opposite strategy which I set tiny profit margins on music instruments while charging more on the music courses and hiring more experienced teachers. Under this business model, students would receive much better educations without paying more tuition. I as the business owner would generate an equal or higher income and better reputations in the long run. Experienced teachers prefer to work for me rather than other institutions due to higher salaries. In 2015, I partnered with Grage Music Co. (takes care of guitar lessons) and upgraded my solo office studio to one of the largest music studios in the city.

>My business was not limited to music education. In 2015,  I started an experimental business project. I initiated Jinan College Musician’s League, which united college musicians and local musicians together. We also organized over 10 music festivals in a year with sponsors like Pepsi Co. China and COFCO Group in Jinan.

### Unique Melody Co.—Marketing Specialist
>Unique Melody Co. (UM) is one of the largest high-end headphone manufacturers in Asia. In 2019, they hired me as their marketing specialist in charge of the US and the Pacific region’s business. During the year of 2019, I set up the UM’s dealerships in Indonesia and Singapore corporates with local audio stores in there. In 2020, I brought UM’s products to the world's largest headphones exhibition—New York Canjam Headphones show. Combining the early advertisement with an on-site introduction, one of UM’s new product MEST soon became one of the bestselling headphones in the $1000-2000 price range. I helped UM generated over 50 units sales in the US market within two months, which broke their sales record. In the following months, I constructed an online survey to obtain more detailed user feedback and constructed a data-based report which guided UM to update their sales strategy.
