## Research on a Dual Problem Solution Strategy under Supply-hub Mode (revising, planning resubmits to International Journal of Production Research)

> **Abstract** 
As the supply chain node integrates different suppliers’ component inventories, a supply-hub is facing the problems of limited storage capacity and unallowed stock-out. This article takes the minimum total supply chain costs as the target to solve these two problems. By considering the dual replenishment methods for space constraint and urgent replenishment, it establishes a multi-varieties inventory control model under random demands to get the optimal inventory strategies for different components. Finally, through simulation analysis, this paper finds that changes in the total storage area, lead time for components and holding cost per unit time for components will significantly affect both inventory strategies for different components and total supply chain costs. Increasing unit purchase costs for urgent replenishment has a remarkable effect on total supply chain costs, but the effect is not significant on inventory strategies for different components.

## Forecasting Stock Returns Using Machine Learning Methods (Capstone Research)

>**Abstract** 
Forecasting stock return is an important topic in the finance industry. However, the stock market has high volatility which makes the price movements hard to be predicted. Eugene Fama and Kenneth French introduced the Fama-French three-factor model in their research paper Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds (1993). The traditional Fama-French Three-Factor model applied the conventional multiple linear regression model, which is still powerful in evaluating stocks and comparing investment results when stocks are held for different periods. However, in recent years, machine learning methods are taking advantage of calculating speed and forecast accuracy. Therefore, in this project, we will evaluate the model performance for both traditional linear models and machine learning models. In this project, we applied multiple linear regression, univariate linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network, models. All models selected Market Excess Return (Mkt.RF) as the most important factor, followed by SMB, then HML. However, machine learning methods cannot outperform linear models in terms of output accuracy. We will, in the end, briefly discuss the potential reasons and project limitations.

# Project


## Sentiment Analysis Model Build for Great American Insurance Group

>**Introduction**
Great American Insurance Group wanted a reproducible pipeline that can derive useful information from tweets and associate a sentiment score for each tweet. The company provided us five hundred thousand tweets with “#drones” collected from 2017 to 2020 as the training dataset. 
During this project, we worked through Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Topic Modeling, Data Labeling, and Transfer Learning to get the final deliverable. We had built various model options based on Natural Language Processing tools like Word2vec, GloVe, Fasttext combined with CNN and LSTM neural networks.

## Supply Optimizer & Sales Channel Decision Tree Made for Unique Melody

>**Introduction**
In February and March 2020, I was in charge to initiate online survey for Unique Melody—a Chinese high-end headphone company. I designed the survey to ask potential customers about what their preferred music genres are and whether they are interested in our potential new product — “MEST International Edition (MEST IE)”.   
There are 33 participants who have taken the survey. 32 of them are interested in MEST IE. However, I did not directly count this number as the last reference, because the design of MEST IE might not complement all participants’ music taste. Based on their preferred genres, I believe 27 out of the 33 participants are potential buyers of MEST IE.  
Most of the data comes from the survey and some supporting data comes from the experience or historical data provided by Unique Melody and Musicteck.com (the main distributer). 
The project is trying to figure out whether Unique Melody should launch this new product and how many headphones they should make for the first batch. In this project, I will first assume that Unique Melody will launch the MEST IE, then I will calculate what is the optimal supply Unique Melody should make and I will use that number in the tree model to determine whether Unique Melody should use distributors or self-marketing if MEST IE will eventually be launched.
